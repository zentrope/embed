A small interpreter to explore the idea of using a small language to create little grammars or parsers or evaluators or rules you can add to a Golang program as data. Something you could use if a single regular expression doesn't really work all that well for you.

I'm thinking this is a kind of string processing kind of DSL. You can pass in a giant text file, and a bit of script and it can return parts of the file as a result, or build an aggregate out of it.
